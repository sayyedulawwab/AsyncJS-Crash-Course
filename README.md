## What did I learn

I did this to understand what asynchronous programming is and how to do it in JavaScript.

### What is Synchronous Programming vs Asynchronous Programming?

Synchronous programming is when tasks are done serially and Asynchronous programming means that multiple tasks can be done
simultaneously.

There are multiple ways to do asynchronous programming in JavaScript. The most typical is callbacks, functions that are called when the actions complete. But programming asynchronously is made easier by promises, objects that represent actions that might complete in the future, and async functions, which allow you to write an asynchronous program as if it were synchronous.
